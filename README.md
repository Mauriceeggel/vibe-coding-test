# Vibe Coding Log

Small web experiments built by vibe coding, for the course *Creative Coding: Future of Web* (2026–2027).

The site is published with GitHub Pages. The home page (`index.html`) lists every project; each project lives in its own folder.

## Projects

| Date | Project | Folder |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 2026-10-08 | Shared Listening Room | [`26-10-08-soundroom/`](26-10-08-soundroom/) |

## Structure

```
.
├── index.html              home page: the list of projects
├── 26-10-08-soundroom/
│   └── index.html          Shared Listening Room
├── README.md
├── .nojekyll               serve files as they are, without Jekyll
└── .gitignore
```

## Adding a project

1. Create a folder named `YY-MM-DD-name` with an `index.html` inside.
2. In the home page `index.html`, copy one `<li>` of the list, put it at the top and change the date, link, title and note.
3. Add a row to the table above.

## Notes

- Shared Listening Room is also published on claude.ai, where visitors who have the page open at the same time hear each other. On GitHub Pages there is no shared room: each visitor is alone, with the simulated presences.
